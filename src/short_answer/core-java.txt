What is OOP? Define each OOP concept.
Answer: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic
  * Inheritance. Classes can reuse code from other classes. Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, enabling developers to reuse common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy
  * Abstraction is a process where you show only “relevant” data and “hide” unnecessary details of an object from the user.
  * Encapsulation: Encapsulation simply means binding object state(fields) and behaviour(methods) together. If you are creating class, you are doing encapsulation
  * Polymorphism is a object oriented programming feature that allows us to perform a single action in different ways

Answer:
* final is the keyword and access modifier which is used to apply restrictions on a class, method or variable.
Explain the difference between final, finally and finalize?
Answer:
*Final  (a) Once declared, final variable becomes constant and cannot be modified.
        (b) final method cannot be overridden by sub class.
        (c) final class cannot be inherited.
* Finally (a) finally block runs the important code even if exception occurs or not.
          (b) finally block cleans up all the resources used in try block
*  Finalize method performs the cleaning activities with respect to the object before its destruction

What is a constructor?
Answer:
* a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class is created
Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
Answer:
* Yes, a Class in  can have more than Constructor.
If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
Answer:
* If a class does not explicitly declare any, the Java compiler automatically provides a no-argument constructor, called the default constructor.
What is "this" keyword in Java? When would we use it?
Answer:
* The "this" keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.
What is "super" keyword in Java? What are some scenarios we would use it?

  *  Use of super with variables and with the methods.
